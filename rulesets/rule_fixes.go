	oas3ExamplesFix string = "Examples are critical for consumers to be able to understand schemas and models defined by the spec. " +
		"Without examples, developers can't understand the type of data the API will return in real life. Examples are turned into mocks " +
		"and can provide a rich testing capability for APIs. Add detailed examples everywhere!"

	unusedComponentFix string = "Unused components / definitions are generally the result of the OpenAPI contract being updated without " +
		"considering references. Another reference could have been updated, or an operation changed that no longer references this component. " +
		"Remove this component from the spec, or re-link to it from another component or operation to fix the problem."

	ambiguousPathsFix string = "Paths must all resolve unambiguously, they can't be confused with one another (/{id}/ambiguous and /ambiguous/{id} " +
		"are the same thing. Make sure every path and the variables used are unique and do conflict with one another. Check the ordering of variables " +

	noVerbsInPathFix string = "When HTTP verbs (get/post/put etc) are used in path segments, it muddies the semantics of REST and creates a confusing and " +

	operationsErrorResponseFix string = "Make sure each operation defines at least one 4xx error response. 4xx Errors are " +
		"used to inform clients they are using the API incorrectly, with bad input, or malformed requests. An API with no errors" +
		"defined is really hard to navigate."
